# Stream of consiousness:
I will be using things that I am already familiar with.  Usually would research before moving forward.
Will note decision points as I go.
Will commit red-green conditions so you can get a flow of my work.
Will breakdown feature into smaller stories outlined below.
Breakdowns will not break previous functionality while providing some testable thing.

## Story: Receive subsidiary sales file
1. Feature testing with capybara, if interfacing with QA or Product Owner/Manager would possibly use Cucumber.
1. I typically don't test controllers as there should be no business logic there, features test the combining aspects of them.
1. This first story is probably a bit smaller than would typically do, but just want to show some process.
Tasks:
1. Create app
1. Create route, controller, views
1. Add upload form to view
1. Display success message

### Would usually verify good and bad data here, but assignment is that we can assume it is good.

## Story: Process & store
1. Test with DB until things become too slow, then will start mocking (so not in this small app)
1. I put in values that I expect in my test, not derived from input (having the test check for eq 4 instead of looking at the file)
1. Model method process_upload is at the limit of what I would like to see for functionality.  Would refactor if more functionality needed.
Tasks:
1. Create migration & model
1. Read file
1. Parse & compile data
1. Store in DB
1. Link controller to model
1. Return success/failure message

## Story: Add total gross revenue to output
1. Refactor process_upload as too much functionality is happening inside of it.
1. See flaw if they upload the same data more than once.  Would be another story to fix that functionality.
Tasks:
1. Add total return to model
1. Display total in view
