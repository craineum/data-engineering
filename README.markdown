# Stream of consiousness:
I will be using things that I am already familiar with.  Usually would research before moving forward.
Will note decision points as I go.
Will commit red-green conditions so you can get a flow of my work.
Will breakdown feature into smaller stories outlined below

## Story: Receive subsidiary sales file
1. Feature testing with capybara, if interfacing with QA or Product Owner/Manager would possibly use Cucumber.
1. I typically don't test controllers as there should be no business logic there, features test the combining aspects of them.
Tasks:
1. Create app
1. Create route, controller, views
1. Add upload form to view
1. Display success message
